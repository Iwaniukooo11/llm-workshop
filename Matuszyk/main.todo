Basic Requirements:
    - Find Model and Concept dataset: @done
        - Identify model on Hugging Face Hub that predicts some concepts based on the input @done
        - Prepare a dataset that model can use to predict concepts @done
    - Set up an interpretation pipeline:
        - Implement LLM-based interpretation using careful prompt engineering
        - Design effective prompting strategies
        - Create evaluation metrics to assess concept prediction accuracy and simulation performance
